Project Insights and Description
Project Aim & Purpose
The aim of this project is to segment customers in an online retail business using K-Means clustering based on RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) analysis. The purpose of segmentation is to identify different customer groups to optimize marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and maximize sales.

Dataset Overview

InvoiceNo: Unique identifier for each transaction.

StockCode & Description: Product details.

Quantity & UnitPrice: Transaction values.

InvoiceDate: Date of purchase.

CustomerID: Unique customer identifier.

Country: Location of the customer.

Data Processing & RFM Analysis

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and treating outliers.
RFM Analysis: Customers are evaluated based on

Recency: How recently a customer made a purchase.

Frequency: How often a customer makes purchases.

Monetary: The total amount a customer has spent.

Feature Engineering: Computing RFM scores and scaling data for clustering.
