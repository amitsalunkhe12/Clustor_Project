    "## 1) Understanding Problem Statement\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement:\n",
    "Online retailers have a vast customer base with diverse shopping behaviors.

    "## 2) Understanding concept of RFM Analysis\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recency Frequency Monetary (RFM) Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "RFM Analysis is a **customer segmentation technique** used by businesses to better understand and categorize their customers based on their **past purchasing behavior**. This approach helps companies identify and target specific customer groups for marketing and personalization efforts. Here's a breakdown of the three components of RFM Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Recency (R):** Recency refers to **how recently a customer has made a purchase or interacted with your business**. It is typically measured in terms of the **number of days since the last purchase or interaction**. Customers who have engaged with your business **more recently** are often considered **more valuable** because they are more likely to make repeat purchases.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Example: A customer who made a purchase 3 days ago is considered more recent than a customer who made a purchase 3 months ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Frequency (F):** Frequency measures **how often a customer makes purchases or interacts with your business** over a specific period such as a year. It represents **customer loyalty and engagement**. Customers who buy from you frequently are more likely to be loyal and responsive to promotions.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Example: A customer who makes monthly purchases is considered more frequent than a customer who makes annual purchases.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Monetary (M):** Monetary represents the **total amount of money a customer has spent on your products or services**. It helps determine the **value or profitability of each customer**. Customers who have **spent more money** are typically considered **high-value customers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Example: A customer who has spent Rs. 1,000 with your business is considered more valuable than a customer who has spent Rs. 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach behind RFM Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "RFM Analysis involves **scoring or ranking** customers based on these three dimensions. Each dimension is typically divided into **categories or percentiles** (e.g. quintiles or deciles) and customers are assigned scores or labels based on where they fall within these categories. For example, you might score recency from 1 to 5, with 5 being the most recent and do the same for frequency and monetary value. Once customers are assigned RFM scores, they can be segmented into different groups. These segments can then be used for various marketing and customer engagement strategies such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Targeted marketing campaigns:** Focus marketing efforts on high RFM-score segments that are more likely to respond positively.\n",
    "- **Customer retention:** Identify at-risk customers (e.g. low frequency or monetary value) and implement strategies to retain them.\n",
    "- **Personalization:** Tailor product recommendations or content to match the preferences and behavior of each segment.\n",
    "- **Product development:** Use RFM insights to inform product or service offerings for different customer segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real Life Industry Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retail Industry:**\n",
    "   - **Promotion Targeting:** Retailers use RFM segments to identify high-value customers who are more likely to respond positively to discounts and promotions. They can then tailor their marketing campaigns to specifically target these segments.\n",
    "   - **Inventory Management:** RFM can help retailers manage inventory by understanding which products are most popular among different customer segments. This information helps optimize stock levels and product placement.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **E-commerce:**\n",
    "   - **Personalized Recommendations:** Online retailers use RFM data to provide personalized product recommendations to customers based on their past behavior, increasing the likelihood of additional purchases.\n",
    "   - **Cart Abandonment Recovery:** RFM can help identify customers who frequently abandon their shopping carts. Retailers can then send targeted follow-up emails or incentives to encourage them to complete their purchases.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hospitality and Tourism:**\n",
    "   - **Customer Loyalty Programs:** Hotels and airlines use RFM analysis to reward loyal customers with special offers, upgrades or discounts thereby encouraging repeat bookings.\n",
    "   - **Seasonal Pricing:** Understanding the recency and frequency of bookings allows businesses in this sector to adjust pricing strategies for different seasons and periods of high demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Financial Services:**\n",
    "   - **Risk Assessment:** Banks and insurance companies use RFM Analysis to assess customer risk. Customers who exhibit erratic behavior in terms of recency, frequency and monetary transactions may be flagged for further review.\n",
    "   - **Cross-Selling:** Financial institutions can identify opportunities to cross-sell or upsell products and services to customers based on their RFM profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Subscription Services:**\n",
    "   - **Churn Prediction:** Subscription-based businesses like streaming services or SaaS companies use RFM to predict customer churn. They can then take proactive measures to retain customers showing signs of disengagement.\n",
    "   - **Tiered Pricing:** Different subscription tiers can be offered to customers based on their RFM scores, ensuring that they receive the level of service that matches their value to the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Healthcare:**\n",
    "   - **Patient Engagement:** Healthcare providers use RFM to segment patients and tailor communication strategies to encourage regular check-ups or follow-up appointments.\n",
    "   - **Medication Adherence:** Understanding the frequency and recency of prescription refills can help healthcare professionals identify patients who may need additional support to adhere to their treatment plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Nonprofits and Fundraising:**\n",
    "   - **Donor Engagement:** Nonprofit organizations analyze RFM to identify and engage with their most committed donors, helping to optimize fundraising efforts and donor retention.\n",
    "   - **Campaign Effectiveness:** Understanding the monetary contributions and recency of donations can help nonprofits assess the success of various fundraising campaigns."

    "The skewness values indicate the distribution of Recency, Monetary, and Frequency features in the dataset. Recency has a slight negative skew (-0.366), meaning most customers made recent purchases. Monetary is close to a normal distribution (-0.262), suggesting balanced spending patterns. Frequency has a moderate negative skew (-0.912), implying that repeat buyers are somewhat more common. These insights help determine whether transformations are needed before clustering. Reducing skewness can improve model performance by ensuring features are more normally distributed, making customer segmentation more effective."
